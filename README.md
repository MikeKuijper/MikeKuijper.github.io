## An introduction

Hello, my name is Mike Kuijper. As of writing this I am 14 years old, and I live in the Netherlands. I really like space, physics, chemistry and science as a whole. A little more than a year ago I decided I wanted to work for SpaceX, so I started to prepare myself by practising with programming and do research to find out how things (related to space) work. I already knew how to program, but I started to learn C++, and I created a smartphone app. It's called Space Calculator and you can use it to estimate how a (model) rocket will perform in-flight. 

## Current Projects

1. Rocket Landing Simulator
2. Space Calculator (fixing bugs, improving app)
3. ??
