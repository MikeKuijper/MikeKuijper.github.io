## An introduction

Hello, my name is Mike Kuijper. As of writing this I am 14 years old, and I live in the Netherlands. I really like space, physics, chemistry and science as a whole. A little more than a year ago I decided I wanted to work for SpaceX, so I started to prepare myself by practising with programming and do research to find out how things (related to space) work. I already knew how to program, but I started to learn C++, and I created a smartphone app. It's called Space Calculator and you can use it to estimate how a (model) rocket will perform in-flight. <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.tridius.kuijper.mike.spacecalculator&pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png'/></a>
